# 1.0 Critique of Visualisation

The original visualisation was created using data from the following sources:

* *origin_destination_bus_SZ_202201.csv*, this data set was downloaded from LTA Datamall and URA region, planning area and planning subzone information were added by using GIS Overlay operation.

* *MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL*, this data provides URA Master Plan 2014 Planning Subzone boundary map in ESRI shapefile format. It was downloaded from data.gov.sg.

## 1.1 Clarity

| S/N        | Critique           |
|:--- |:----------------------------------------------|
|1|**Use of Adjacency Matrix**: The use of the adjacency matrix to reveal information on intra and inter bus trip flows was not clear in this execution. The labels on both the destination and origin subzones were completely compressed and as such it is not immediately clear what kind of flow we are looking at. The use of black and white as the %total of trips also resulted in difficulty distinguishing which combination of origin-destination had the highest number of trips (based on colour) because of the number of bus stops on both the x and y-axis.|
|2 |**No chart titles/insights**: Lack of chart titles to clearly separate the type of information conveyed. It is not immediately clear what the adjacency matrix hopes to achieve, and the 4 barplots in the same colour without clear titling results in some initial confusion to distinguish that the 2 barcharts on the left are for origin subzones, and the two on the right are for destination subzones.|
|3 |**Misleading x-axis labels for bar-chart**: The bar-chart which aims to reveal the number of trips per hour on a weekday/weekend was missing the data for 0-4h which is available in the dataset.|

## 1.2 Aesthetics

| S/N        | Critique           |
|:--- |:----------------------------------------------|
|1|**Legend**: The legend for the origin and destination subzones contain too many radio-button options and requires the user to scroll down to look for the relevant subzone of choice for both fields. A single drop-down list could be more appropriate to make the dashboard look less cluttered.|
|2 |**Colour**: Single use of the colour blue for the barcharts for both origin and destination trips which look repetitive. One possible improvement could be to use two different colours to clearly differentiate barcharts relating to origin subzones, and destination subzones respectively to provide a visual aid for viewers.|
|3 |**Multiple Charts in One View**: The proportions of the charts could have been better scaled or separated in multiple views (through the Story function in Tableau). Adjacency matrix could be bigger vs. the barcharts - currently the view results in the adjacency matrix looking very compressed.|
|4 |**No labels on y-axis**: Bar-chart has no labels on the y-axis except "Weekday" and "Weekend" and users must currently infer that it refers to the total trips based on the title of the chart.|

## 1.3 Interactive Design

| S/N        | Critique           |
|:--- |:----------------------------------------------|
|1|**Poor use of filters**: The current filters for destination and origin subzones could be better represented as a dropdown list - single filter. Instead of 2 charts for weekday and weekends, a filter could be used to save on visual clutter.|
|2 |**Lack of dynamic filter on Adjacency Matrix**: Dynamic filters for Origin/Destination Subzones could be applied to the weekday adjacency matrix so that a more cohesive story between the number of trips by origin vs. the adjacency matrix can be told. |
|3 |**Lack of filtering on specific time periods**: The current filters do not allow for viewers to get a view on the travel patterns at specific time periods which may be of interest considering different commute patterns during peak and off-peak periods during weekdays. One improvement could be the addition of a dynamic time filter which can be applied to all views in this prototype.|

# 2.0 Proposed Design

The image below shows an initial sketch of the proposed design.


**Advantages of Proposed Design:**

### 2.1 Clarity

**Better use of colours**: The new design assigns brown/orange to information relating to Origin subzones, and green to information relating to Destination subzones. Moreover, the various shades also help to indiciate the number of trips (with a higer intensity suggesting a higher number of trips - in relation to the geographical map, relative to other subzones.

**More concise titles**: Comparing with the initial visualisation where views were not clearly demarcated with vague labels like "Weekday" and "Weekend", and filters all placed on the right, the proposed visualisation helps to more clearly position the filters in a more aesthetically pleasing manner, and where appropriate, at the right chart so users are not confused by which filter applies on which chart. Titles also dynamically change in response to filters used.

**Tooltips**: Previous tooltips did not have subzone information. Current proposed visualisation will have the subzone information together with number of trips.

### 2.2 Aesthetics

**Cleaner layout which is easier on the eyes**: The proposed visualisation makes use of the "Story" functionality in Tableau to create multiple compartmentalised views which results in less clutter compared to the old visualisation. We will place geographical maps in the main tab, followed by the analysis at the number of trips generated/attracted by the origin/destination subzones, as well as their corresponding top destination subzones and top origin subzones respectively.

**Use of colours**: Use of colours to indicate that orange is for the origin data and green is for destination data, making it less confusing for users on first viewing.

**Labelling**: Where necessary, clearer labels have been used e.g. for the bar charts instead of just "Weekday" without a label on the y-axis, the proposed visualisation uses labels such as "Total Trip from Origin Subzone", and "Total Trips to Destination Subzone" to remove any ambiguity.

### 2.3 Interactivity

**Single Dropdown filter for origin/destination subzone**: Use of drop-down filter results in less visual clutter.

**Slider filter for duration**: Use of slider filter for duration can be more intuitive for users to selecting a range, and is an added functionality from the original visualisation which did not allow viewers to drill down to a specific time frame for the data.
