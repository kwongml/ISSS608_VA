  In this post, we present a bus-trip origin-destination data use case in applying the fundamentals of Visual Analytics using Tableau. The article aims to critique the visualiation and provide alternatives to improve it from its current state.

# 1.0 Critique of Visualisation

The original visualisation was created using data from the following sources:

* *origin_destination_bus_SZ_202201.csv*, this data set was downloaded from LTA Datamall and URA region, planning area and planning subzone information were added by using GIS Overlay operation.

* *MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL*, this data provides URA Master Plan 2014 Planning Subzone boundary map in ESRI shapefile format. It was downloaded from data.gov.sg.

## 1.1 Clarity

| S/N        | Critique           |
|:--- |:----------------------------------------------|
|1|**Use of Adjacency Matrix**: The use of the adjacency matrix to reveal information on intra and inter bus trip flows was not clear in this execution. The labels on both the destination and origin subzones were completely compressed and as such it is not immediately clear what kind of flow we are looking at. The use of black and white as the %total of trips also resulted in difficulty distinguishing which combination of origin-destination had the highest number of trips (based on colour) because of the number of bus stops on both the x and y-axis.|
|2 |**No chart titles/insights**: Lack of chart titles to clearly separate the type of information conveyed. It is not immediately clear what the adjacency matrix hopes to achieve, and the 4 barplots in the same colour without clear titling results in some initial confusion to distinguish that the 2 barcharts on the left are for origin subzones, and the two on the right are for destination subzones.|
|3 |**Misleading x-axis labels for bar-chart**: The bar-chart which aims to reveal the number of trips per hour on a weekday/weekend was missing the data for 0-4h which is available in the dataset.|

## 1.2 Aesthetics

| S/N        | Critique           |
|:--- |:----------------------------------------------|
|1|**Legend**: The legend for the origin and destination subzones contain too many radio-button options and requires the user to scroll down to look for the relevant subzone of choice for both fields. A single drop-down list could be more appropriate to make the dashboard look less cluttered.|
|2 |**Colour**: Single use of the colour blue for the barcharts for both origin and destination trips which look repetitive. One possible improvement could be to use two different colours to clearly differentiate barcharts relating to origin subzones, and destination subzones respectively to provide a visual aid for viewers.|
|3 |**Multiple Charts in One View**: The proportions of the charts could have been better scaled or separated in multiple views (through the Story function in Tableau). Adjacency matrix could be bigger vs. the barcharts - currently the view results in the adjacency matrix looking very compressed.|

## 1.3 Interactive Design

| S/N        | Critique           |
|:--- |:----------------------------------------------|
|1|**Poor use of filters**: The current filters for destination and origin subzones could be better represented as a dropdown list - single filter. Instead of 2 charts for weekday and weekends, a filter could be used to save on visual clutter.|
|2 |**Lack of dynamic filter on Adjacency Matrix**: Dynamic filters for Origin/Destination Subzones could be applied to the weekday adjacency matrix so that a more cohesive story between the number of trips by origin vs. the adjacency matrix can be told. |
|3 |**Lack of filtering on specific time periods**: The current filters do not allow for viewers to get a view on the travel patterns at specific time periods which may be of interest considering different commute patterns during peak and off-peak periods during weekdays. One improvement could be the addition of a dynamic time filter which can be applied to all views in this prototype.|

# 2.0 Proposed Design

The image below shows an initial sketch of the proposed design.


**Advantages of Proposed Design:**

**a) Clear Titles (Main, Chart Titles, and Sub-Titles)**

* Main title reflects what the entire dashboard aims to present (i.e. an analysis/charts pertaining to Singapore's Labour Force Participation Rate and Distribution by Age Bands (2010 - 2021))

# 3.0 Proposed Visualisation on Tableau

The final proposed visualisation created using *Tableau Desktop* can be accessed via *Tableau Public* [**here**](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mei.lin.kwong/viz/DatavizMakeover2_16483315684060/BusTripOrigin-Destination-Jan2022).
